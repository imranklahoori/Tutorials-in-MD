# Introduction to HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to create web pages. It is a markup language, which means that it uses tags to define the structure and content of a web page.

The purpose of HTML is to create web pages that can be displayed in a web browser. Web browsers are programs that allow users to access and view web pages.

## Brief history of HTML development

HTML was first developed in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee, a British computer scientist. Berners-Lee was working at CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, when he developed HTML as a way to share information with other researchers.

The first version of HTML was very simple, but it has evolved over time to become a powerful and versatile language. HTML5, the latest version of HTML, was released in 2014.

## How HTML works

HTML is a markup language, which means that it uses tags to define the structure and content of a web page. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (<>). For example, the following HTML code creates a heading:

```html
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
```

When a web browser encounters an HTML tag, it knows how to display the content of the tag. For example, when a web browser encounters the `<h1>` tag, it knows to display the text inside the tag as a heading.

HTML tags can be used to create a variety of different elements on a web page, including headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and links.

## Conclusion

HTML is a powerful and versatile language that is used to create web pages. It is a relatively easy language to learn, and it can be used to create a wide variety of web pages.

# Basic Structure of HTML

An HTML document consists of the following components:

* **HTML tags:** HTML tags are used to define the structure and content of a web page. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (<>). For example, the following HTML code creates a heading:

```html
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
```

* **Attributes:** Attributes are used to provide additional information about an HTML tag. Attributes are specified within the opening tag. For example, the following HTML code creates a link to Google:

```html
<a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>
```

* **Content:** The content of an HTML document is the text, images, and other elements that are displayed on the web page. Content is placed between the opening and closing tags of an HTML element. For example, the following HTML code creates a paragraph of text:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
```

## Example of a simple HTML code snippet

The following is an example of a simple HTML code snippet:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  <p>This is my first web page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

This code snippet creates a simple web page with a heading and a paragraph of text. When this code is opened in a web browser, it will display the following:

```
Hello, world!

This is my first web page.
```

## Conclusion

The basic structure of HTML is relatively simple. By understanding the components of an HTML document, you can start creating your own web pages.
