```html
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
```

* **It is a declarative language:** HTML is a declarative language, which means that it tells the web browser what to display, but not how to display it. For example, the following HTML code creates a paragraph of text:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
```

The web browser will automatically display the paragraph of text in a readable format.

* **It is a platform-independent language:** HTML is a platform-independent language, which means that it can be used to create web pages that can be viewed on any device, including computers, smartphones, and tablets.

## Basic syntax and structure of HTML code

An HTML document consists of the following components:

* **The HTML tag:** The HTML tag is the root element of an HTML document. It contains all of the other elements in the document.
* **The head element:** The head element contains information about the document, such as the title and the author.
* **The body element:** The body element contains the content of the document, such as the text, images, and links.

The following is an example of a simple HTML document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First Web Page</title>
</head>

HTML tags are used to define the structure and content of a web page. HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page. Each element is defined by a start tag and an end tag.

### HTML Tags

HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets (<>). The start tag defines the beginning of an element, and the end tag defines the end of an element. For example, the following HTML code creates a heading:

```html
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
```

The `<h1>` tag is the start tag, and the `</h1>` tag is the end tag. The text between the start and end tags is the content of the element.

### HTML Elements

HTML elements are the building blocks of a web page. Each element has a specific purpose. For example, the `<h1>` element creates a heading, the `<p>` element creates a paragraph, and the `<a>` element creates a link.

### Opening and Closing Tags

Most HTML elements have both an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag defines the beginning of an element, and the closing tag defines the end of an element. For example, the following HTML code creates a paragraph:

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

The `<p>` tag is the opening tag, and the `</p>` tag is the closing tag. The text between the opening and closing tags is the content of the paragraph.

### Some HTML elements, such as the `<br>` element, do not have a closing tag.

### Styling Text in HTML

There are two ways to style text in HTML:

* **Using inline styles:** Inline styles are applied to individual HTML elements using the `style` attribute.
* **Using external style sheets:** External style sheets are separate CSS files that are linked to HTML documents.

### Using Inline Styles

To apply inline styles to an HTML element, use the `style` attribute. The `style` attribute takes a CSS style declaration as its value. For example, the following code applies a bold style to a heading:

```html
<h1 style="font-weight: bold;">This is a heading</h1>
```

### Using External Style Sheets

To use an external style sheet, link to the CSS file in the `<head>` section of your HTML document. For example, the following code links to a CSS file named `style.css`:

```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
```

Once you have linked to a CSS file, you can use CSS rules to style the text in your HTML document. For example, the following CSS rule applies a bold style to all headings:

```css
h1 {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

### Example of Styling Text in HTML

The following is an example of how to style text in HTML using inline styles and external style sheets:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <h1 style="font-weight: bold;">This is a heading</h1>
  <p style="font-size: 16px;">This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
```

This code uses an inline style to bold the heading and an external style sheet to set the font size of the paragraph to 16px.

## Conclusion

Styling text in HTML is essential for creating web pages that are visually appealing and easy to read. You can use inline styles or external style sheets to style the text in your HTML documents.

# Topic 14

  * `<p align="right">`: Right-align the text.
* **Font styles:**
  * `<b>`: Bold the text.
  * `<i>`: Italicize the text.
  * `<u>`: Underline the text.
* **Font sizes:**
  * `<font size="1">`: Set the text to the smallest font size.
  * `<font size="2">`: Set the text to a small font size.
  * `<font size="3">`: Set the text to a medium font size.
  * `<font size="4">`: Set the text to a large font size.
  * `<font size="5">`: Set the text to the largest font size.
* **Emphasis and strong emphasis:**
  * `<em>`: Emphasize the text.
  * `<strong>`: Strongly emphasize the text.

### Example of Formatting Text

### HTML Links

HTML links are used to create hyperlinks in web pages. Hyperlinks allow users to click on text or images to navigate to other web pages or to specific sections of the current page.

### Creating Anchor Tags for Linking to External or Internal Pages

To create a hyperlink in HTML, you use the `<a>` tag. The `<a>` tag has two required attributes:

* `href`: The `href` attribute specifies the URL of the page that the link will go to.
* `text`: The `text` attribute specifies the text that will be displayed as the link.

For example, the following code creates a hyperlink to Google:

```html
<a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>
```

When a user clicks on this link, they will be taken to the Google homepage.

You can also use the `<a>` tag to create links to specific sections of the current page. To do this, you use the `id` attribute to specify the ID of the section that you want to link to. For example, the following code creates a link to a section of the current page with the ID "about":

```html
<a href="#about">About</a>
```

When a user clicks on this link, they will be taken to the section of the page with the ID "about".

### Example of an HTML Link

The following is an example of an HTML link:

```html
<p>Click here to visit <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>.</p>
```

This code will produce the following output:

```
Click here to visit Google.
```

When a user clicks on the "Google" link, they will be taken to the Google homepage.

## Conclusion

HTML links are an essential part of web pages. They allow users to navigate to other web pages or to specific sections of the current page. You can create links using the `<a>` tag. The `<a>` tag has two required attributes: `href` and `text`. The `href` attribute specifies the URL of the page that the link will go to, and the `text` attribute specifies the text that will be displayed as the link.

# Topic 16

### Hyperlink Attributes

In addition to the `href` and `text` attributes, the `<a>` tag has a number of other attributes that can be used to control the behavior of the link. Some of the most common hyperlink attributes include:

* **target**: The `target` attribute specifies the frame or window in which the linked document will be displayed. The following values are supported:
  * `_self`: The linked document will be displayed in the same frame or window as the current document.
  * `_blank`: The linked document will be displayed in a new window or tab.
  * `_parent`: The linked document will be displayed in the parent frame of the current document.
  * `_top`: The linked document will be displayed in the topmost frame of the current window.
* **rel**: The `rel` attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document. The following values are supported:
  * `alternate`: The linked document is an alternate version of the current document.
  * `canonical`: The linked document is the canonical version of the current document.
  * `next`: The linked document is the next document in a series.
  * `prev`: The linked document is the previous document in a series.
* **type**: The `type` attribute specifies the MIME type of the linked document.

### Using Images as Clickable Links in HTML

You can use images as clickable links in HTML by wrapping the image in an `<a>` tag. For example, the following code creates a link to Google using an image:

```html
<a href="https://www.google.com"><img src="google.png" alt="Google"></a>
```

When a user clicks on the image, they will be taken to the Google homepage.

### Example of Hyperlink Attributes

The following is an example of an HTML link with attributes:

```html
<a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank" rel="alternate">Google</a>
```

This code will create a link to Google that will open in a new tab or window. The link will also be marked as an alternate version of the current document.

## Conclusion

Hyperlink attributes allow you to control the behavior of links in HTML. Some of the most common hyperlink attributes include `target`, `rel`, and `type`. You can also use images as clickable links in HTML by wrapping the image in an `<a>` tag.
